Unfortunately, it\\'s pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives. But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area.\\nLoosing the War on Terrorism \\\\\\\\\"Sven Jaschan, self-confessed author of the Netsky and Sasser viruses, is\\\\responsible for 70 percent of virus infections in 2004, according to a six-month\\\\virus roundup published Wednesday by antivirus company Sophos.\"\\\\\\\\\"The 18-year-old Jaschan was taken into custody in Germany in May by police who\\\\said he had admitted programming both the Netsky and Sasser worms, something\\\\experts at Microsoft confirmed.
